A sore ignored becomes the opening  
`Dm 4 bars`  
A mega bleed no end in sight  
`Dm 4 bars`  
You stuff her in to stop the hemorrhaging  
`Dm 4 bars`  
The shadow grows the longest light  
`Dm 4 bars`

You bleed yourself away  
`Dm 4 bars`  
Every time you think of hers

You bleed yourself away, away, away, away

## Verse (2:39)

* **Arnold Layne**

Your hair relaxes in the shinning sun  
`Dm 2 bars, then 2 bars solo`  
your grin stretches from ear to ear  
`Dm 2 bars, then 2 bars solo`  
the weeds you plant rapidly grow below  
`Dm 2 bars, then 2 bars solo`  
and some day one day they'll suck you in  
`Dm 2 bars, then 2 bars solo`  

She fits so nicely smiling next to you  
`Dm 4 bars solo`  
Someone should really clue her in  
`Dm 4 bars solo`  
One thousand hers will never quell the fool  
`Dm 4 bars solo`  
Nor stop the mega bleed within  
`Dm 4 bars solo`  

## Chorus (3:31)

You bleed yourself away  
Every time you think of hers  
Every time you drink of hers  
You bleed yourself away, away, away, away, away, away, away  
`Dm 8 bars`  
Every time you think of hers  
Every time you sleep with hers  
You bleed yourself away, away, away, away, away  
`Dm 8 bars`
