# Mega

A sore ignored becomes the opening  
a mega bleed no end in sight  
you stuff her in to stop the hemorrhaging  
the shadow grows the longest light  

You bleed yourself away  
every time you think of hers  
every time you drink of hers  
you bleed yourself away, away, away, away  

Your hair relaxes in the shinning sun  
your grin stretches from ear to ear  
the weeds you plant rapidly grow below  
and some day one day theyâ€™ll suck you in  

She fits so nicely smiling next to you  
Someone should really clue her in  
One thousand hers will never quell the fool  
Nor stop the mega bleed within  

You bleed yourself away  
every time you think of hers  
every time you drink of hers  
You bleed yourself away, away, away, away, away, away, away  
every time you think of hers  
every time you sleep with hers  
you bleed yourself away, away, away, away, away
