Time falls silent  
The clock makes no sound  
And the animals in their cages  
Are the only ones to survive  

Time falls quickly  
Time recedes from view  
And the animals in their cages  
Are the only ones, only ones to survive  
The animals in their cages  
Are the only ones, only ones to survive  

Ohh the animals in their cages  
Are the only ones  
only ones
only ones  
holy ones  
only ones  
only ones  
holy ones  
only ones  
only holy ones  
Hold me once  
Only once  
Lonely ones
