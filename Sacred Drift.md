# Sacred Drift

You came from a long way  
Across the sacred drift  
Twisting this shape-shift world  
Deep within the silhouette  
My stillness reveals you  
Painful fever starts  
You came from a long way  a long way a long way

You came from the dark star   
and the unknown city  
Holding death’s mirror of fear  
Reflecting our brutality  
 I dig within you  
All matter turns to flames  
You came from a long way a long way a long way

You came as the power  
The awaken dead  
Transfixing the light through dark  
Of the sacred polar spin  
I center within you  
All my edges thin  
You came from a long way a long way a long way

I want to melt with you  
I want to be your light  
I want to be your love  
I'm gonna see the skies  
Of real love  
I’m gonna be your love  
Melt with you
