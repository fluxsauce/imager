## Intro

Do you... know the sound that a soul can make?  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
How could you? Deaf to all but your dinner plate?  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
I'm hiding... below in your Apparitions' sea...  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
And I'm watching... you prepare the baited hook for me...  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`

## Verse

Have you... ever taken a risk so dear?  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
That rod your casting... looks like a cheap souvenir?  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
I'm frozen... contemplate a single bite of hell...  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
And your fingers... move so close with your hunger smell...  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`

absurd dualities  
`Am 3 beats, CM 3 beats, Bm 3 beats, Em 3 beats`

## Verse

Pull me... through the air from this sewer main  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
Decayed breath... fill my lungs as the droplets drain  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
Spinning... hangs the line linking me to you  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
and I'd remove it... if I absolutely wanted to  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`

## Intro variation

* Each time, get bigger...

Now there's no edge... smack your lips in a constant loop  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
There's no edge... just a pinch for a favorite soup  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
I feel you... cut my tail with your golden wheel  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`  
Oh I love you... dirty words that my soul reveals  
`Am 10 beats, Em6 8 beats`
