**Do you... know the sound that a soul can make? How

hiding... below with your Apparitions' sea... and I'm  
watching... you prepare the baited hook for me...**

**Have you... ever taken a risk so dear... that

fingers move so close with your hunger  
smell...**

## Verse

Pull me through the air from this sewer main  
decayed breathe fill my lungs as the droplets drain  
Spinning hangs the line linking me to you  
and I’d remove it if I absolutely wanted to  

***Stringy***

`4 x Am 10 beats Em6 8 beats`

## Intro variation

Now there’s no edge - smack your lips in a constant loop  
There’s no edge just a piece for a favorite soup  
I feel you cut my tail with your golden wheel  
Oh I love you, dirty words that my soul reveals  

_Each time, get bigger..._

`4 x Am 10 beats Em6 8 beats`

## Chorus

Don’t you try to sling your multitudes on me  
I swim past all of your absurd dualities  
With one sweet kiss our double mouths start eating  
these dirty little words  
feed dirty little fools  
enlarging empty holes  
that nothing fills in  
that no one fills in  
that nothing fills in
