# Mara

River  
it sucks me in beneath its skin  
it flips the gravitation  
Pulls me through the other side  

To Winter  
Dark and leafless scenery  
In carriage horse machinery  
We ride the never ending night  

Mara  
Wiggles through the keyhole peep  
Her weight on my chest while I sleep  
Her silver whip in hand  

Sound crack  
Electrifies the energy  
She whips her madness on to me  
Accelerating through the land  

What are you waiting for?  
Something outside of you to make you alive again?  
Make you high again, make you lie again  
Haunting images you'll see  
As I lead you down to the sea of bloody misery  

I'm just a girl whistling in the dark  
_I'm just a boy_  
Ahead up the road your waving to stop  
_I'm just a boy_  
I pull on the reins but the horse keeps running  
_I'm just a boy_  
I scream out to move but you just keep smiling  
_I'm just a boy_  

I rock and I sway  
Two magnets in the dark  
I corner too slow  
The whip hits the mark  

Bursting  
Through the room their laughter rings  
The Gods bet on the Mara queen  
In nights her wage is paid  

Crushing  
She unmounts all her weight from me  
Her stare her smell rise abruptly
I lie below her demon gaze  

What are you  
What are you  
What are you waiting for  
What are you  
What are you  
What are you waiting for
