# Gardens

Taste  
Light your lips  
soak your tongue  
strike your eyes  

ohoh  
Akasha Gardens  
The Devil's seas  

Save Us  
Save Us  
Save Us  

entice yourself  
try yourself again  
twist yourself then  
flip yourself  
fly-out to this mortal plane  

don’t understand  
move yourself aside  
Release all movement  
Release all sounds  
and release to the soul ride

ohoh  
Akasha Gardens  
The Devil's Sea

Save Us  
Save us  
Save us  
Save me  

wohhhhh

_Oh hell you’ve come here_  
_you’ve come to the right place_  
Its a beautiful place, am I dead  
_You’re frightened of me  
I can see it in your eyes_  
I’ve given up everything  
and I’ve cleared everything away  
and I’m nothing inside but  
raw metal  
my head is spinning  
I don’t want to be the same as you  
I don’t want to be like you  
I just want to be gone  
and move myself away  
_release yourself_  
I’m something  
_let me lift you up above_  
_above the giants_  
no, let go of me  
I need to move outside  
and see where I need to go  
_I will give you what ever you wanted_  
_if you go I won’t stop you but I won’t let you go_  
You can never lock me up again  
_trust me, trust me_  
I have a voice
